# Climine

Climine, a lightweight scripting language, prioritizes simplicity and customization. With a clear syntax for functions and input handling, it serves as an accessible tool for quick tasks and facilitates the understanding of fundamental scripting concepts.


## Example

```javascript
let age = input("Enter age:");

try{
    let age = num(age);
} handle {
    display(age & " is not a valid age");
    exit();
};

if (age>17){
    display("Eligible to vote");
} else {
    display("Ineligible to vote");
};

let count = 0;
until (age>17){
    let count = (count + 1);
    let age = (age + 1);
} else {
    display("Can vote in "&count&" years");
};

```
